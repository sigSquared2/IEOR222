This quantitative finance project represents a unique opportunity to apply modern financial engineering theory using conventional techniques to address multiple challenges pertaining to the valuation of derivative instruments and the examination of implied volatility. Our comprehensive analyses traverse a range of financial products, including European options and zero-coupon bonds. By leveraging the power of time-honoured models and methodologies, such as Black-Scholes, Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR), Newton-Raphson, and Monte Carlo simulation, we seek to uncover the hidden dynamics that shape the behaviour of these complex instruments.
